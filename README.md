**Self-Learning AI Mentorship App for Students**

Mentorly is a self-learning platform designed for students who want to improve academically at their own pace. It identifies weak and strong areas, suggests topics to focus on, and motivates students through daily quizzes, achievements, and leaderboards.

This project was inspired by my own journey as an average student who discovered the power of self-learning and mentorship.
